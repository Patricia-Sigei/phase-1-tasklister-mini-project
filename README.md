Take a look at the [MDN Documentation on `Event.preventDefault()`][mdn-pd].
You'll see how JavaScript is used to prevent a form element (checkbox) from
doing its _default_ behavior (appearing checked upon click). You'll want to
prevent `submit` from doing its default behavior in a similar fashion.

### Stretch Deliverables

Once you've got the required deliverables working, you may want to try to
implement one or more of the following:

- A delete function that will remove tasks from your list
- A priority value selected from a [dropdown][] that is used to determine the
  color of the text in the list (e.g. red for high priority, yellow for medium,
  green for low)
  - As an additional challenge, implement a sorting functionality that displays
    the tasks in ascending or descending order based on priority
- An additional input field (e.g. user, duration, date due)
- Ability to edit tasks
- Something of your choice! The main objective is to add a feature that allows
  the user's input to affect the DOM
